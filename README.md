# The project
In this project I was using Redux to built a classic todo application. The user is able to add new todos, remove them and clear all. The appplication includes @reduxjs/toolkit & Material UI

## The built🪓 & challanges 🤯

✏️I started out by sketching out what your app will look like and how I can use  components. When using redux, it is easier to break things into many small, manageable components.

Once I have my sketch, I thought about how the data in your store should look. What data does a todo task contain:
Here I added actions to the tasks like: 
✅toggle
✅remove 
✅add 

The app also includes: Clear all function, input field and category selector for new tasks which are saved in local storage 

🤯Here I struggled a bit with how to set ut up in a correct way so data can be changed through dispatching the action-payload to the store. This therefore involved googling solutions, looking at other peoples solution and trying to understand the overall flow of redux. This helped me  a lot when writing the redux actions and then using that data in your components.

⏰ In this project was the first time using both Redux toolkit and material ui so there is a lot left there to learn. But in this project if I had more time I would actually work more on understanding the flow. Not understanding the complete flow makes the code a bit more messier than needed.
